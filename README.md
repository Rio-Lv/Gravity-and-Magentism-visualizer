# An Exploration of the CO-DEPENDENCY of GRAVITY and MAGNETISM
Gravity and Magnetism have many similar attributes. Many of which are described by the simple inverse square law. In order to potentially discover new correlations and phenomena, I created a simulation using Processing and Java
<p>The Space around it reveals interesting patterns depending on the motion the particle takes.The following shows the formation of field lines as the particle moves through the space on a 2D plane</p>

<p>When the simulation is changed to 3D, The are interesting formations resemblant of SP Orbitals. These formation varies of the elevation of the plane</p>

<p>Differences were also observed when changing the number of planes and the orientation fo the planes</p>

<p>The following video shows how the particle is interacting with the space and is the basis for the derivation of other observations</p>
